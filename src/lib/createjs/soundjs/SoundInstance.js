     * A SoundInstance is created when any calls to the Sound API method {{#crossLink "Sound/play"}}{{/crossLink}} or
     * {{#crossLink "Sound/createInstance"}}{{/crossLink}} are made. The SoundInstance is returned by the active plugin
     * for control by the user.
     *
     * <h4>Example</h4>
     *     Sound.play("myAssetPath/mySrcFile.mp3");
     *
     * A number of additional parameters provide a quick way to determine how a sound is played. Please see the Sound
     * API method {{#crossLink "Sound/play"}}{{/crossLink}} for a list of arguments.
     *
     * Once a SoundInstance is created, a reference can be stored that can be used to control the audio directly through
     * the SoundInstance. If the reference is not stored, the SoundInstance will play out its audio (and any loops), and
     * is then de-referenced from the {{#crossLink "Sound"}}{{/crossLink}} class so that it can be cleaned up. If audio
     * playback has completed, a simple call to the {{#crossLink "SoundInstance/play"}}{{/crossLink}} instance method
     * will rebuild the references the Sound class need to control it.
     *
     *     var myInstance = Sound.play("myAssetPath/mySrcFile.mp3");

     *     function playAgain(event) {
   *         myInstance.play();
   *     }
     *
     * Events are dispatched from the instance to notify when the sound has completed, looped, or when playback fails
     *
     *     var myInstance = Sound.play("myAssetPath/mySrcFile.mp3");
